Build Instructions
==================

Clownfish is a "symbiotic" object system for C which is designed to pair with
a "host" dynamic language environment, facilitating the development of high
performance host language extensions.  Currently it is available for Perl and
plain C libraries.

Clownfish runtime
-----------------

To build the Clownfish runtime for Perl, chdir to the "runtime/perl"
subdirectory underneath the "clownfish" top level and follow the instructions
in the INSTALL document there.

To build the Clownfish runtime for C, chdir to the "runtime/c" subdirectory
underneath the "clownfish" top level and follow the instructions in the
INSTALL document there.

The Clownfish runtime build requires the Clownfish compiler and will build it
first.

Clownfish compiler
------------------

To only build the Clownfish compiler with Perl bindings, chdir to the
"compiler/perl" subdirectory underneath the "clownfish" top level and follow
the instructions in the INSTALL document there.

To only build the Clownfish compiler "cfc" executable, chdir to the
"compiler/c" subdirectory underneath the "clownfish" top level and follow the
instructions in the INSTALL document there.
